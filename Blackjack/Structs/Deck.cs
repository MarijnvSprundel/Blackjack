namespace Blackjack.Structs;

public struct Deck
{
    // This struct will contain 52 card instances
    // Will have function grab
    // but is it better to remove grabbed cards or mark them? IRL if a card is grabbed from the deck well it aint in the deck no more
    // so just remove it from deck
    // makes shit a lot easier since we dont have to filter the list to only get actual cards
    // 
    // Methods:
    // Grab() => Grabs first card from the deck
    // Shuffle() => Shuffles the deck
    // Constructor will add 52 cards to deck, none of them duplicate
